## Interface

**parse**`(input, options)` is the main interface to the library. The
`input` parameter is a string, `options` must be an object setting
some of the options listed below. The return value will be an abstract
syntax tree object as specified by the [ESTree
spec](https://github.com/estree/estree).

```javascript
let acorn = require("acorn");
console.log(acorn.parse("1 + 1", {ecmaVersion: 2020}));
```

When encountering a syntax error, the parser will raise a
`SyntaxError` object with a meaningful message. The error object will
have a `pos` property that indicates the string offset at which the
error occurred, and a `loc` object that contains a `{line, column}`
object referring to that same position.

Options are provided by in a second argument, which should be an
object containing any of these field
